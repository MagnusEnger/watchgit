watchgit - fetch from remotes and output RSS of new commits

Create a directory called repo, create a git repository in it and
add lots of remotes to it: 

 mkdir repo
 cd repo
 git init
 git remote add origin git://git...
 
Running ./watchgit.sh fetches from all the remotes and outputs any
new commits as RSS.
